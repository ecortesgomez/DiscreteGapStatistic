\title{sample-to-sample heatmap clustering samples according to a given categorical distance
Exploratory tool that helps to visualize/cluster blocks of observations across columns ordered according to given categorical distance. The final output is a clustered distance matrix.
This plot is aimed to guide the `DiscreteClusGap` user to give an idea which type of categorical distance would accommodate better to the inputted data.
`sample2sampleHeat` is based on the `pheatmap` function from the `pheatmap` R package. Thus, any parameter found in pheatmap can be specified to `sample2sampleHeat`.}
\usage{
distanceHeat(x, distName, clustering_method = "complete", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix object or data.frame}

\item{distName}{Name of categorical distance to apply.}

\item{clustering_method}{string; clustering method used by pheatmap}

\item{...}{other valid arguments in pheatmap function
Available distances: 'bhattacharyya', 'chisquare', 'cramerV', 'hamming' and 'hellinger'.}
}
\value{
clustered heatmap
