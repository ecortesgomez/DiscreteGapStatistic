\usage{
clusGapDiscr0(
  x,
  FUNcluster,
  K.max,
  B = nrow(x),
  value.range = "DS",
  verbose = interactive(),
  distName = "hamming",
  useLog = TRUE,
  Input2Alg = "distMatr",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix object specifying category attributes in the columns and observations in the rows.}

\item{FUNcluster}{a function that accepts as first argument a matrix like `x`; second argument specifies number of `k` (k=>2) clusters
This function should return a list with a component named `cluster`, a vector of length `n=nrow(x)` of integers from `1:k` indicating observation cluster assignment.
Make sure `FUNcluster` and `Input2Alg` agree.}

\item{K.max}{Integer. Maximum number of clusters `k` to consider}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap samples. By default B = nrow(x).}

\item{value.range}{String, character vector or a list of character vectors with the length matching the number of columns (nQ) of the array.
A vector with all categories to consider when bootstrapping the null distribution sample (KS: Known Support option).
By DEFAULT vals=NULL, meaning unique range of categories found in the data will be used when drawing the null (DS: Data Support option).
If a character vector of categories is provided, these values would be used for the null distribution drawing across the array.
If a list with category character vectors is provided, it has to have the same number of columns as the input array. The order of list element corresponds to the array's columns.}

\item{verbose}{Integer or logical. Determines whether progress output should printed while running. By DEFAULT one bit is printed per bootstrap sample.}

\item{distName}{String. Name of categorical distance to apply.
Available distances: 'bhattacharyya', 'chisquare', 'cramerV', 'hamming' and 'hellinger'.}

\item{useLog}{Logical. Use log function after estimating `W.k`. Following the original formulation `useLog=TRUE` by default.}

\item{Input2Alg}{Specifies the kind of input provided to the algorithm function in `FUNcluster`.
For algorithms that only accept a distance matrix use `'distMatr'` option (default).
For algorithms that require the dataset and a prespecified distance function (e.g. `stats::dist`) use the `'distFun'` option.
This case the distance function is defined internally and determined by parameter `distName`.}

\item{...}{optionally further arguments for `FUNcluster()`}
}
\value{
a matrix with K.max rows and 4 columns, named "logW", "E.logW", "gap", and "SE.sim",
where gap = E.logW - logW, and SE.sim correspond to the standard error of `gap`.
